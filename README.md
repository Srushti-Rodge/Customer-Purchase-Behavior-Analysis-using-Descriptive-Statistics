# Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis-using-Descriptive-Statistics 
# Overview
Welcome to the Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis project! This project involves the thorough analysis of a dataset containing customer information and purchasing behavior. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, ultimately providing valuable insights to optimize marketing efforts and increase offer acceptance rates.

**Project Tasks and Deliverables**
**Task 1 - Basic CleanUp**
**Cleaned and Preprocessed Dataset:**

Detailed report on handling missing values and data types.

Ensured consistency in data types for each variable.

**Summary of Basic Statistics:**

Calculated mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for relevant numerical variables.

**Task 2 - Descriptive Statistics**
Calculated measures of central tendency and dispersion for key variables. Identified and handled outliers when necessary.
**
**Task 3 - Probability Distributions****
Determined suitable probability distributions for relevant variables. Calculated probabilities and expected values based on these distributions.

**Task 4 - Insights and Customer Segmentation**
Explored relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits. Segmented customers based on behaviors and characteristics.
**
**Task 5 - Conclusion and Recommendations****
Designed visualizations showcasing key insights. Provided actionable recommendations for the company based on the analysis.

**Key Insights and Recommendations**
The analysis revealed several critical insights, including:

Education Demographics: Target graduation-level students with tailored marketing campaigns.

Marital Status and Birth Years: Craft promotions suitable for married individuals in the 1960-1980 age range.

Campaign Response Dynamics: Investigate reasons behind a high number of declines and refine future campaigns.

Wine Expenditure and Income: Target customers with higher incomes for wine-related promotions.

Income and Product Spending: Tailor product promotions based on income levels.

Offer Acceptance Ratio by Education: Design offers appealing to graduation-level students.

Marital Status and Offer Decline: Customize offers for married customers to increase acceptance rates.

Widows' Spending Patterns: Design promotions catering to widows to increase spending.

Recency Rate by Marital Status: Explore and capitalize on the higher recency rate in the "Absurd" category.

Purchase Preferences: Optimize in-store experiences and promotions based on customer preferences.


**Conclusion:**
1.The analysis of customer demographics and spending behavior revealed differences between customers who responded to marketing campaigns and those who did not, particularly in various product categories.
2.The provided dataset underwent essential data cleaning and preprocessing, including the handling of missing values and the conversion of different columns to a datetime object.
3.Descriptive statistics were calculated for numerical variables, offering insights into the dataset's central tendencies and variations.
4.While specific probability distributions were not explicitly determined, further exploration may be needed to assess their suitability and calculate probabilities and expected values.
5.To derive more meaningful insights and actionable recommendations, a more comprehensive analysis, including statistical tests and machine learning models, is recommended to identify significant predictors of customer responses and refine marketing strategies.
